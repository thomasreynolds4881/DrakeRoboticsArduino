# Drake Robotics Arduino
The Code Repository for the Drake Robotic's Group Robot, Mother.  Mother is an arduino powered robot that will chase a person and play music.  The faster Mother moves, the faster the tempo of the music plays.  Mother will be controlled by a Javascript application where the user can activate Mother and choose what songs Mother will play.  The user may also be given the ability to control how drastic speed changes based on movement.
